This project shares insights into different countries' transactions in borrowing loans from the World Bank. We will analyze the countries that have borrowed the most loans and how much they owe to IDA.
Using SQL, we get insights into how the countries are spending loan amounts on different ongoing projects and whether they are paying back these loans to IDA.

In this analysis, I've helped the education department and School administration to find out helpful insights. We found out how different aspects affect School's graduation rates. We've analyzed using Tableau that if changes are made to inside school's strategies of having bigger or smaller classroom sizes, does it affect the percentage of students who attend college each year? We found some great insights.

This analysis includes the relationship between customers' income and their spending behavior. I analyzed different factors and patterns that can affect their income spent on DoorDash. I visualized the data with the help of Scatter plots, Bar Charts, and histograms.
